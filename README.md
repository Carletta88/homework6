# Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## My Task

Create a 5 day weather dashboard using third party APIs. The dashboard should run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML CSS and Javascript. The recent searches should run in the browser and allow the user to click on them and load the coorisponding weather information.

---

## Functions
* The user should be able to search for weather by typing in the city name
* The dashboard should save all the recent user entries using local storage
* The dashboard should load the current weather data as well as the data for the upcoming 5 days
* The API Key should return the weather data upon submission

## Below you will find an illistration showing an example of how the dashboard should look:
